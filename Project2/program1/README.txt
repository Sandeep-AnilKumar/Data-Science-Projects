Program comments: -
--------------------------------
1. All punctuations have been removed from the course names
2. In the course names "intro" and "intro." have been replaced with "introduction"
3. "&" is replaced with "and" in all course names.
4. Roman numerals both uppercase like 'III' and 'II' have been converted to uppercase only.
5. Also for the professor names, only last name is used. So for e.g. A. Prasad Sistla, only Sistla is used. Similarly for types of 'firstname, lastname' and 'firstname lastname'.
6. Input filename for clean.py is taken from command line arguments, as such while running 'clean.py' give 'class.txt' as an argument. While running 'query.py' I have hardcoded the value for 'cleaned.txt' since we will be running 'clean.py' before 'query.py'.
7. 'cleaned.txt' is created after running 'clean.py'
