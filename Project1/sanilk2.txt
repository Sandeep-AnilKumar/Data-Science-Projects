If the attribute "area" in Dim_Type can have more than one value then I think this column would be similar to the Address column, which can have Street name, City, State in one column. To work around this we can divide Dim_Type table into two seperate tables i.e. Dim_Type into Dim_Type and Dim_Type_Area. Dim_Type can then have a schema like 
(id number, area_id number, type varchar);
primary_key would be id, area_id
Dim_type.area_id will be a foreign key, which references Dim_Type_Area.id

e.g. now Dim_Type can have two areas for same id.
id	area_id
1	2
1	3

where 2 and 3 can be any valid id's from Dim_Type_Area table.

Dim_Type_Area can have schema like 
(id number, area varchar);
primary_key would be id.

Ofcourse we would have to normalize the tables to avoid redundancies and other dependencies issues.
